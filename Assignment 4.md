## What type of machine learning models did the creator use?

Douyin AI Clone is powered by ByteDance's self-developed Doubao Large Language Model (formerly called Yunque), which is an LLM similar to ChatGPT. What makes it special is its personalized fine-tuning for each creator—the training process includes collecting data, supervised fine-tuning, evaluation and feedback. The model also has continuous learning capabilities, constantly absorbing the creator's speaking style and interaction habits to make the AI clone more and more like the real person. It supports both text and voice interactions, making conversations between fans and the AI clone feel more natural.


## What data was used to train the machine learning model?

The training data mainly comes from materials provided by the creators themselves. Creators need to fill out tons of personal information, including character design, knowledge base, voice samples, images, etc.—some bloggers said it took them two full days just to fill out the forms. Then they have to continuously "feed" data to the AI, like one blogger uploaded over 2,000 clips of Q&A sessions from their livestreams. Besides that, the creator's published content and historical interaction records on Douyin are also used for training. What's interesting is that creators can actually see the chat logs between fans and their AI clone, so the AI can keep optimizing itself based on real fan interactions and better understand what fans want.

## Why did the creator choose to use this machine learning model?

Creators use AI clones mainly to solve the "not enough hands" problem. Top MCN agencies say their influencers need to handle hundreds of thousands of private messages every month, and AI clones can handle 70% of those repetitive inquiries, greatly reducing the operational burden. Plus, AI clones can be online 24/7, automatically replying to fans in private messages, group chats, comment sections, and livestreams—creators no longer have to worry about losing fans due to slow responses. What's even better is that AI clones maintain the creator's personal style—for example, a beauty blogger's AI clone will recommend product videos and shopping links, while a medical blogger's AI clone can provide online consultations. For businesses, this brings real commercial value by helping them convert fans more efficiently. Essentially, AI clones help creators break through the limitations of time and energy, allowing them to better manage their private domain traffic.
