# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manling Yang

Welcome to my **NYU IMA Introduction to Machine Learning 4 Arts** personal work blog! This is where I document my creative journey exploring the fascinating world of AI and interactive arts.

## About Me ðŸŒŸ

I'm a senior student at **NYU** studying **IMA, Interactive Media Arts**, originally from China and currently living in Brooklyn. As a creative technologist, I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of AI, interactive media, and human expression.

When I'm not coding or training models, I love exploring Brooklyn's art scene, experimenting with new technologies, and finding ways to make complex concepts accessible and fun. There's something magical about turning abstract machine learning algorithms into tangible, interactive experiences!

## What You'll Find Here ðŸŽ¨ðŸ¤–

This blog documents my adventures in **Introduction to Machine Learning for Arts** - from experimenting with sound classification to building voice-controlled games. I love turning complex ML concepts into playful, interactive experiences that anyone can enjoy.

## My Learning Philosophy ðŸ’­

I believe the best way to understand technology is to **build something fun with it**. Whether it's training models, debugging code, or designing user experiences, I'm always asking: *"How can this create joy or wonder?"*

Coming from a different cultural background, I bring a unique perspective to how we interact with technology and what it means to create meaningful digital experiences.


## Course Journey ðŸ“š

This blog represents my learning process in NYU IMA's Introduction to Machine Learning course. You'll see my growth from understanding basic concepts to building complex interactive projects. I document both successes and failures - because that's how real learning happens!

## Let's Connect! ðŸŒŸ

As a student navigating the intersection of art and technology, I'm always excited to:
- Share what I'm learning (mistakes included!)
- Collaborate with fellow students and creators
- Discuss cultural perspectives on AI and creativity
- Help others get started with ML + Arts
- Connect with the broader NYU and Brooklyn creative communities

Feel free to explore my experiments, try out the interactive demos, and don't hesitate to reach out if you want to chat about creative technology, student life in NYC, or anything in between!
