Blog Post: Assignment 3 Reading Responses

Reading 1: "Mixing movement and machine" by Maya Man
Maya Man's work really got me thinking about how we can use our bodies as a creative interface with machine learning. What I found most interesting is how she treats movement not just as input data, but as a form of expression that gets transformed through the machine's interpretation. Her approach to combining dance and code feels really personal and playful—it's not about making the technology disappear or about showcasing the tech for its own sake. Instead, it's this genuine collaboration where her movement and the ML model are in dialogue with each other.
I also appreciate how she talks about the unpredictability and "mistakes" that happen when working with pose detection. Rather than seeing these as failures, she embraces them as part of the creative process. It makes me think differently about how I approach coding—maybe I should be more open to the unexpected outputs instead of always trying to achieve perfect control. The idea that the machine's misinterpretation can become a creative feature is pretty liberating.

Reading 2: "Humans of AI" by Philipp Schmitt
Philipp Schmitt's "Humans of AI" project is both fascinating and a bit unsettling. The way he reveals the hidden labor behind AI training data—real people posing for synthetic training images—really challenges the myth that AI is this autonomous, objective technology. I never really thought about the fact that behind every pose detection model, there were actual humans performing and capturing these poses. It's easy to forget that ML models are trained on data created by real people with their own biases and limitations.
What struck me most is how this project makes visible the "invisible" workers in the AI pipeline. It reminds me of how we often don't think about all the human labor that goes into technologies we use every day. For this assignment, it makes me more conscious about what the models are actually "seeing" and how that might affect my creative work. Like, when I use BodyPose, I should think about whose bodies were used to train it and what movements it might recognize better than others.

Reading 3: "Open Sourcing the Origin Stories" by Ellen Nickles
Ellen Nickles' work on documenting the provenance of ml5.js models is super important but honestly something I never thought about before. The "biography" approach to understanding where models come from, who created the training data, and what decisions were made along the way is eye-opening. After reading this and the Schmitt piece, I'm realizing how much context we lose when we just download a model and start using it without knowing its history.
Questions I still have: I'm curious about the demographic diversity of the people in the training datasets for BodyPose and BodySegmentation. Like, does it work equally well for people of different ages, body types, and abilities? I'd also want to know more about the environmental conditions the training data was captured in—different lighting, backgrounds, camera angles. I think these details should definitely be in the model biography because they affect how the model performs in different contexts.
How this informs my creative process: Knowing the provenance makes me think more critically about what I'm creating. If I know a model has limitations or biases, I can either work within those constraints intentionally or try to subvert them creatively. It also makes me more responsible as a creator—I can't just blame "the AI" if something doesn't work or produces problematic results. Understanding where the model comes from helps me make more informed decisions about when and how to use it.
