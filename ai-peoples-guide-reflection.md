Reflecting on "A People's Guide to AI": From Concepts to Practice
1. My First Four Thoughts When Hearing "Artificial Intelligence"

When I hear the term "artificial intelligence," four distinct images emerge in my mind:
a. Robots and Virtual Assistants
My first thought goes to voice assistants like Siri and Alexa that have seamlessly integrated into our daily routines. These AI companions represent the most tangible manifestation of AI in our immediate environment, responding to our queries and managing our digital lives.
b. Algorithms and Big Data
I immediately think of the vast algorithmic systems powering social media feeds, e-commerce recommendations, and personalized content curation. These invisible forces shape what we see, buy, and consume, operating through massive data collection and analysis.
c. Sci-Fi Dystopian Scenarios
My mind conjures images from films like 007 and The Matrix—intelligent agents with self-awareness that eventually dominate and enslave humanity. This reflects our collective cultural anxiety about AI's potential to surpass and subjugate its creators.
d. Automation and Economic Disruption
I think about AI-driven workflow automation that brings both excitement and anxiety about employment impacts. AI's emergence has fundamentally reshuffled the employer-employee relationship that has existed since the Industrial Revolution, exacerbating the imbalance between production and productivity distribution.

Reflection: These initial impressions reveal AI's dual nature in our culture—simultaneously serving as practical tools and vessels for our deepest fears and aspirations. They demonstrate how we simultaneously view AI as both present reality and future possibility, highlighting the tension between utility and uncertainty.

2. Daily AI Activity Analysis

Location Tracking and Navigation
Usage Frequency: Multiple times daily
Data Collection:GPS positioning, movement patterns, dwell times, route preferences
Privacy Impact: Complete life trajectory mapping and behavioral profiling
Critical Question: Is the convenience truly worth the comprehensive surveillance of our movements?

Shopping Recommendation Systems
Taobao, Amazon, TikTok Shop, and countless e-commerce sites
Critical Question:** To what extent do recommendation systems manipulate rather than serve our genuine preferences?

Social Media
WeChat Moments, Weibo timelines, Instagram feeds
Interaction Analysis:Every like, comment, share, and scroll duration becomes data
Critical Question:Are algorithms serving us, or have we become servants to algorithmic engagement optimization?

Content Recommendation Engines
Spotify Discover Weekly, NetEase Cloud Music personal radio
YouTube recommendations, Bilibili's algorithmic feeds
Cultural Impact:Shapes taste formation while potentially limiting exposure to diversity
Critical Question: How does algorithmic curation affect our cultural development and openness to new experiences?

3. Image Classification Experiment: How AI "Sees" the World

Using the image classification code provided in the book, I tested various images and made several revealing discoveries:
Successfully Identified Content:
Cats, dogs, cars, and common household items achieved high accuracy rates
Optimal Conditions:Well-lit, front-facing images with clear subjects performed best
Simple Compositions: Single-subject images with minimal background complexity

Classification Failures:
Traditional Chinese architecture was consistently misclassified as Western-style buildings
Artistic works and abstract images resulted in completely incorrect classifications
Complex Scenes:Multi-object compositions or unclear/incomplete images proved nearly impossible to analyze accurately

Key Factors Affecting Classification:
Lighting Conditions
Object Proportion and Background Complexity

Critical Discoveries and Reflections:

a. Training Data Bias: AI models clearly favor Western cultural visual contexts, revealing significant cultural limitations in training datasets and highlighting the non-neutral nature of AI systems.

b. Visual Standardization: Models expect "standard" image conditions, potentially reflecting a form of visual hegemony that privileges certain aesthetic norms over others.

c. Contextual Understanding Gap: While humans interpret images through rich contextual understanding, AI focuses on isolated visual features, missing the broader meaning and cultural significance.

d. Enhancement Strategies:** To make AI appear more intelligent, we need parameter adjustments and expanded training databases that include more diverse, culturally representative data.

f. AI Agent Specialization: Different AI models excel in different domains—ChatGPT's coding capabilities differ from Claude's, while Alibaba's Qwen shows stronger visual understanding. This specialization has spawned diverse AI products targeting specific use cases.
